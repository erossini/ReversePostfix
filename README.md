I will show how to evaluate Postfix expression for your interviews as a C# developer. When you have interviews, you never know what they will ask you. Sometimes, the easiest question could be the most complicated thing. I don't know you, but I found this snap test interview quite boring. For example, when in the real work you have to evaluate a Postfix expression?

The full explanation of this code is on my [post "Evaluate Postfix expression for interviews"](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/evaluate-postfix-expression-for-interviews/) on [PureSourceCode](https://www.puresourcecode.com/).
